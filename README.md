# Balanced Budget

A basic budget/finance app built with tRPC, NextJS, and Prisma ORM.

## Description

An app that lets a user track their finances manually. Each transaction is entered by the user to show, with info like category, description, and payor/payee tracked along with the transaction.

A dashboard gives an overview of the user's finances with a bar graph showing the past 6 months total expenses and income, and a line graph shows change in net worth over the past 6 months.

A report view shows a pie chart covering the spend by category over a month period.

## Future Plans

Eventually, users will be able to create budgets to keep themselves within a certain limit for a category or categories. They will also be able to set goals, such as saving up for a big purchase item.

## How do I take a look?

Go to [Balanced Budget](https://balanced-budget.up.railway.app/) and click login. Currently you can login with your discord account. Once in, you will be taken to a new account page, where you can click "Create Demo Data" to create fake accounts and transactions to see and play around with the app.
